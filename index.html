        <h1>For New Yorkers that want to go plant-based, Meatless Mondays are just a start</h1>
        <span class="byline"> By Amanda D'Ambrosio, Mallika Mitra and Kelly Zegers</span>
        <p>“Meatless Mondays” are on their way to New York City public schools. In March, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that beginning in the 2019-2020 school year, schools will provide students with all-vegetarian menus for breakfast and lunch
          every Monday. Many New York officials congratulated the mayor on the initiative. </p>
        <p>“Learning to eat healthy food is one of the most important lessons our children can gain as part of their education; and access to healthy food is an essential part of our preventative care,” State Senator Alessandra Biaggi said in a
          statement. </p>
        <p> But “Meatless Mondays” doesn’t solve the problem of inaccessibility to healthy foods in all New York City neighborhoods. What if students, whether they are from a low- or high-income community, want to continue a plant-based diet in
          their everyday lives? </p>
        <p>Prices of plant-based diet staples vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. We compared the prices of staples in the neighborhood with the highest average median household income (SoHo with $125,300), the lowest (Hunts Point with $25,000)
          and one in the middle (Jackson Heights with $50,800). The incomes are according to a 2017 report published by New York City’s Comptroller Scott Stringer. </p>

        <p>Inaccessibility to plant-based food stems from a lot of different things, in addition to the prices.</p>
        <p>“A lot of it comes down to convenience,” said Erick Castro, co-owner of Rip’s Malt Shop who runs an Instagram account called “How to be vegan in the hood.” “If a mom comes home late from work, it’s hard for them to cook something
          different.”</p>
        <p>Aside from the challenge of convenience when cooking plant-based, it may also be difficult to find accessible and affordable vegan food items across borough lines.</p>
        <p>“We have vegan products available in the Bronx,” said Alexis Montoya, activist and founder of The Bronx Vegan. “It’s just so hard to find because there is not really an emphasis on the veganism or plant-based eating.”</p>
        <p>Montoya, who has practiced a plant-based lifestyle for the past year and a half, said that stores and restaurants sell plant-based products without advertising those items as vegan. And while she may be able to find staples for her
          plant-based diet at her local grocery store, vegan meats and cheeses that make cultural cuisine in her community come to life are not yet available in supermarkets.</p>
        <p>“I think the trend really hasn’t hit as prominently as it has in other boroughs,” she said. </p>

        <p>To determine which neighborhoods we would use, we used New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer’s 2017 edition of the Neighborhood Economic Profiles report. We visited one of the neighborhoods with the highest median household income
          (SoHo), one of the neighborhoods with the lowest (Hunts Point) and one in the middle (Jackson Heights). We wanted to go to grocery stores that are most likely used by the average resident and not specialty stores. To find those, we Googled
          “grocery stores in [insert neighborhood]” and went to the first chain supermarkets that came up. In SoHo, we visit Morton Williams, in Hunts Point we visited Food Bazaar and in Jackson Heights we visited Foodtown.</p>

        <p>To determine which foods we would collect prices for, we spoke to Kayla Slater, a registered dietician who specializes in plant-based diets. At each supermarket, we found the item and collected several prices to ensure that we would be
          able to compare them properly to the other grocery stores. We made sure to avoid organic as not all the stores had those options. Once we collected all our prices, we compared the items that were the exact same and had the same brand (ex.
          all the whole grain pasta was from the brand Barilla).</p>

        <p>For the produce –– which might not have been the exact same brand –– we compared the items of the same measurement (ex. a pound of bananas). Although we matched the foods as closely as possible, there
          will be some margin of error here as not every grocery store had the exact same product for every item we included in our calculator. </p>
